# Dense Neural Network for the BINGO telescope

This is a deep learning algorithm created by Rafael M. Ribeiro(University of Sao Paulo) and is owned by BINGO Telescope. Its use is to predict the best position to install the horns. We use the data from the [GRASP](https://www.ticra.com/software/grasp/) software where we compute some best horn position and use as parameter in the Dense Neural Network. Any question about your operation, please, contact us in rafaelmgr@usp.br.

To use it, python ANN_fit_2.py or
           ./job-sh

The notebos are for a ilustration and analys from the result.

You need to check if there are the Python libraries: numpy, pandas,tensorflow and sklearn.

For more information about the methods, please see this [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01635.pdf)
